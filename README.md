## What it is / What it does
This is a **To-Do List web app**. You can:

- Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- Set deadlines  
- Mark tasks as done  
- Filter tasks (all, active, completed)  
- See how many tasks are left  
- Save tasks so they stay after refreshing  

## Why I made it
I made this to practice **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** and create something useful to stay organized.

## How I made it
I used:  

- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling and animated background  
- **JavaScript** for adding/editing tasks, marking complete, filtering, counting, and saving in local storage  

## Challenges & Learnings
**Challenges:**  

- Making tasks editable  
- Saving deadlines in local storage  
- Updating the “tasks left” counter  

**What I learned:**  

- DOM manipulation  
- Local storage
